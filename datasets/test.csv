(the release version generally date; cvs access recommended. get idea.) meanwhile, rdf/xml production tools inconsistent even rdf experts recommend using rdf tools produce rss 1.0 feed want actually read major rss aggregator. despite two-year-old promise better tools[2], year 2002, built rss 1.0 feed&#8212;in sophisticated personal publishing system world&#8212;by manually typing mishmash template tags angle brackets textarea html form. - extensible namespaces, which, mentioned above, haphazardly poorly incorporated rss 2.0, appear flourishing. evolvable formats&#8212;those proceed adapted extended thousand small ways&#8212;have three main characteristics germane eventual victories strong, centrally designed formats. - solutions produce partial results imperfect tools succeed. rss feed xml document produced template built textarea, consumed hundreds parsers around world know nothing xml hack apart feed regular expressions. world littered formats would worked everyone better tools. everyone world perfect rdf parser disposal, would trivial produce consume world's metadata rdf. without perfect tools, production consumption instantly become nightmares. middle ground. - is, wrong. evolvable formats always adapted earlier conditions always adapted present conditions, always behind times. rss stretched long descriptions, optional titles, entity-encoded html even practices codified spec, long consumers could handle them. evolving format ever perfectly sync challenges faces. - finally, orgel's rule, named evolutionary biologist leslie orgel&#8212;&#8220;evolution cleverer are&#8221;. list rss's obvious deficiencies above, easy point wrong evolvable system point life. one seeing rss 1.0 rss 0.91 side-by-side could doubt rss 1.0 superior technology, &#8220;did things right&#8221;. however, ability understand missing given moment mean one person small central group design better system long haul. designed formats start strong improve logarithmically. evolvable formats start weak improve exponentially. rss 2.0 perfect syndication format, best one that's also currently practical. infrastructure built evolvable formats always partially incomplete, partially wrong ultimately better designed competition.
